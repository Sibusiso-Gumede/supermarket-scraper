# Supermarket Scraper
Instead of scouring product catalogues and grocery websites to find the cheapest price of a grocery product, a shopper can easily access product prices from different supermarkets, in a single repository. Wouldn't that be convenient?

Well, this program helps accomplish a part of that. It scrapes product promotion data from supermarket websites and stores it in a database for application integration purposes.
